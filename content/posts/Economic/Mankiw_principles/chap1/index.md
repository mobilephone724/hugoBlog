2.	Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
3.	More hiring means lower unemployment.

+	**business cycle**:fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production.
